# Street-s-of-Home-game
The idea has been at the back of my mind since early 1970's when we used to build buggies' to race downhill 
Principles of this game is first to build, which is crafting your ride from materials you have to search for in Newcastle upon Tyne to begin with this is about building your ride and testing yourself your skill to avoid obsticles on your way to the finish line at the bottom of any given road that you start on using real life graphics as these days we have emense graphic's cards Ray tracing etc while you compete with other to cross the finish line 1st.
Different type of roads some being more challenging like Lemmington bank high acceleration after you start moving crafting of parts styles all count in this race handling of your vehicle in short, medium or challenging conditions will all add to the game many courses to try and expansion pack to other cities here in England as this begins in Newcastle upon Tyne and its streets but easily expandable to other counties across our great coumtry, how the player builds and upgrades is yours using Geordie Notes as prize money for each event across many courses and leaderboard where the higher you rank the more you earn as well as upgrades or rebuilds of your machine from scratch or fixing it up after accidents meaning eahc player has to use skill through to claim your prize.
Geordie Notes was designed for local business for trading goods as well as normal cash and can be found on the waves.exchange cryptocurrency exchange it was designed to help business accomidate digital money payments as crypto grows across the United Kingdom into 2025 and beyond as in the beginning i wanted an exchange in Newcastle upon Tyne however i no longer live there.
There are many forms of Artificial Intelligence and one of them has the task of writing this game there will be much testing in 2025 until my idea is born which will show off skill, speed, ingineuaty by each person their crafting from zero as in the parts they use to build prize money for winning and stay on the leaederboard which is going to be hard multiple setting easy medium hard and superstar, settings to fit all players will get a challenge especially on tricky terrain at speed, coming off means missing races like in the real world, so you need your wits about you.
Signing up will require each person using pen and paper to write down username and password and 24 random selected lower case words for your digital wallet from a selection on display and it is your wallet after sign up so if you lose the details stored you have to begin again losing any money in the eco sytem as in the real word very important that part all crafting gains goes in your wallet, prize money leaderboard gains goes in your wallet so treat those details like Gold.
This game is also named after my song as wellwhich also covers several streets covered in this exciting game.
Once this game is complete sale price will be Â£50.00 and it will feature expansion areas DLC and new areas to race all within the United Kingdom as the game moves from 2025 through to 2050 showing many changes main office at Newcastle upon Tyne
The feel of my game will make you want to challenge yourself as i did take risks just remember not to get injured as you lose time and you could lose your place on the leaderboard which will take time maybe months to climb back never mind repair costs but do have an amazing experience and hours of crafting your vehicial how you want them build your way be creative and earn as other will ask how much to buy decorate and if you so wish build your garage and fill it with your creations to build and sell or build and race in Streets of home in Newcastle upon Tyne or challenge yourself to the national title it is up to you i want you to play have fun build and earn at the same time if you build a garage, upgrade to chains instead of just going downhill really test your skill your design while earning as you win whether on 4 wheels or 3 if you are brave enough Ai is going to help write a new piece of gaming history i have not seen since i was a young kid.
